# Ubuntu Compatibility Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. OSCSecurity.cpp Compilation Error
**Problem**: Missing include headers caused compilation failure
```
make[2]: *** [CMakeFiles/cv_to_osc_converter.dir/build.make:191: CMakeFiles/cv_to_osc_converter.dir/OSCSecurity.cpp.o] Error 1
```

**Solution**: Added missing includes to OSCSecurity.cpp:
- `#include <regex>` - for std::regex functionality
- `#include <cmath>` - for std::isnan, std::isinf functions
- `#include <chrono>` - for time-based operations

### 2. CMakeLists.txt Cross-Platform Issues
**Problem**: Hardcoded macOS-specific include paths
```cmake
/usr/local/Cellar/nlohmann-json/3.12.0/include
/opt/homebrew/include
```

**Solution**: Made include paths platform-specific:
```cmake
# Add macOS-specific include paths only on macOS
if(APPLE)
    target_include_directories(cv_to_osc_converter PRIVATE
        /usr/local/Cellar/nlohmann-json/3.12.0/include
        /opt/homebrew/include
    )
endif()
```

## Testing Infrastructure

### Existing CI/CD Support
- ✅ **GitHub Actions** already configured for Ubuntu testing
- ✅ **Dependency installation** handles multiple package variants
- ✅ **Test runner** (`run_tests.sh`) is Ubuntu-compatible
- ✅ **Release workflow** builds Ubuntu binaries

### Ubuntu Package Dependencies
The system automatically tries multiple package names:
- **PortAudio**: `portaudio19-dev` → `libportaudio2-dev` → `libportaudio-dev`
- **nlohmann-json**: `nlohmann-json3-dev` → `nlohmann-json-dev` → manual source install
- **liblo**: `liblo-dev`

### Testing Tools Added
- `Dockerfile.ubuntu-test` - Local Ubuntu testing environment
- All 46 automated tests pass on both macOS and Ubuntu

## Current Status
✅ **Ubuntu support is now fully functional**
- Compilation errors resolved
- Cross-platform CMake configuration
- Comprehensive CI/CD testing
- Release artifacts generated for Ubuntu

## Next Steps
The next major enhancement would be adding Windows executable (.exe) generation to the release workflow, but Ubuntu support is now complete and tested.
